. How The Blog System Works - Blog
_

.. Intro
In the last blog, I talked about the website, on it's functionality and features. Today I am going to talk about how the Blog System works. For a little background, see this <a href="https://www.daksh.ga/blogs/my_website_is_complete" target="_blank">post</a>
Or moreover, about how I made a "language" to write my blog posts in easily. I named it ez.js, you can call it what you want :)

.. Features (of ez.js)
-_-
--> 3 Sizes of headings
--> Image support
--> Code Block support
--> Line Breaks
--> Links (anchor tags) support
--> Lists support (Like this one :P)
--> Custom Title
--> Custom CSS
--> Custom JS
--> Inner HTML support
_-_
If you want some functionality which isn't present in it, you can either add it your self or take advantage of inner HTML.

.. A Quick Show
... Code
---------------------------
> . Heading 1
> .. Heading 2
> ... Heading 3
> Normal Text
> Normal text also supports *bold*, _italics_, ~cuts~ and ^small^ text
> <> http://www.gnu.org/graphics/heckert_gnu.transp.small.png
> Images work ^
> > Full line code blocks
> _
> ^ Line breaks
> < https://gnu.org gnu
> ^ Links work
> -_-
> --> 1st
> --> 2nd
> --> 3rd
> _-_
> Lists work ^
> ->> Site Title
> ^ That sets the site title, won't run that here to spoil this page's title :)

... When Converted To HTML:
---------------------------
. Heading 1
.. Heading 2
... Heading 3
Normal Text
Normal text also supports *bold*, _italics_, ~cuts~ and ^small^ text
<> http://www.gnu.org/graphics/heckert_gnu.transp.small.png
Images work ^
> Full line code blocks
_
^ Line breaks
< https://gnu.org gnu
^ Links work
-_-
--> 1st
--> 2nd
--> 3rd
_-_
Lists work ^
^ That sets the site title, won't run that here to spoil this page's title :)
---------------------------
The alligning might look a bit odd, but that's just cause of the CSS I am using.

.. How it Works
There's basically 3 things to it:

... JS
The Heart of this is made in JS, it is what goes through each line and check for certain conditions. Here's an example:
>     lines.forEach(line => {
>
>       const words = line.split(" ")
>       var line_html
>       switch (words[0]) {
>           case ".":
>           line_html = `<h1>${words.slice(1).join(" ")}</h1>`
>           break
This checks if a line starts with the "word" "." and if it does, it makes a h1 tag and enters rest of the words as Inner HTML
As all of this basically is a script setting, Inner HTML You can type HTML and It'd work just fine
Except for Code Blogs, if you type HTML in them, it won't render as HTML. This is done so that I can safely copy paste HTML code to show in the posts.


... Python

You can't just make a new file and start writing ez scripts in them, you need a premade HTML template, and then you can start writing ez scripts in one of the tags. Though, to make things cleaner I have made a "linker" which will link an ez script (which you provide) with some template code, so it makes things less messy.
Currently, this is made in Python. I do plan to rewrite it in something better. Considering it just envolves a bit copy pasting text into files, I might just use C or C++ (Probably C++) or maybe even try something new, Like Go Lang.
But you can ofcourse, just write the scripts in HTML and avoid using the linker at all.

... HTML

As mentioned in the Python section, you can't just make a new file and start writing ez scripts in them, you need a premade HTML template. The template is a small piece of code, has like 15 lines in it. There is a script included, ez.js (the core, see JS section) and then there's a tag in which you write the ez scripts. Which you can avoid writing scripts in by using the linker.

.. How can I use this/Source Code
This project is licensed under the GNU PUBLIC LICENSE, you can find it <a href="https://github.com/CodeDecodeDev/ez-js">here</a>
I wouldn't recommend using it yet, as the linker isn't really that great and I plan to rewrite it (as I mentioned earlier). I will mention it here when it's ready to be used, will also link a blog post explaining the basics (once the blog post and the project itself are out).

.. Thanks!
Thanks for reading this blog post! In the next post, I will (hopefully) make a tutorial on how you can use ez.js for your own projects.</xmp>
